# Artemis-Maps
Artemis Maps is an open-source mapping library that integrates seamlessly with React and Angular applications. It is inspired by prominent mapping libraries such as Leaflet, Mapkick, and Snazzy Maps. The project is designed to provide high-quality, interactive maps with advanced geospatial features, and it is highly customizable for different use cases.
Artemis Maps will include features like route navigation, data visualization, real-time tracking, geospatial analysis, and dynamic map styling, making it a powerful tool for applications requiring maps and location-based services.
